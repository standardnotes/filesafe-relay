# Filesafe Relay

This is the server component that is part of the larger FileSafe system. It deals with relaying files to the proper 3rd party storage provider, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, WebDAV, or S3 Compatible Storage.

## Setting up

### Requirements

#### Google Auth

This is required for an integration with Google Drive.

You need to supply the `client_secrets.json` file in the root directory of the project as is required by [Google Auth Library](https://github.com/googleapis/google-auth-library-ruby/tree/584ad57d7d72d9ffa395daa1dde4c48e04ab3c99#example-web). This can be set up [here](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard).

As an alternative you can set the `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRETS` environment variable in the `.env` file. When running the container, this will create the `client_secrets.json` file with contents of the variable.

### Docker

In order to run the relay server locally, type the following commands:

```
cp .env.sample .env
docker build -t filesafe-relay-local .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env filesafe-relay-local
```
